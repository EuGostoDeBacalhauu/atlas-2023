	"description": "A background pattern of azulejo (typical Portuguese tiles). It was created as a mark of self-determination by a rebel faction from Portugal, composed mostly of veteran artists from previous years whom saw their art edited against their will by a small council of Discord mods and Twitch streamers and put on the main flag in that butchered state. This project was done in a collaboration effort with r/hatsune, r/metallica and r/pizzatower.",
